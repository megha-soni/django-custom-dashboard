# django-custom-dashboard
Made an custom django dashboard with user authentication and authorization like registration , 
login, logout and different roles for admin and regular user . And have also applied middleware 
and session with an inactive timeout of  10 minutes in it. I have also applied custom form validations in it.
and I have also applied custom validations on form fields like name should be greater than 4 character , password should be greater than 8 characters,
contact number must be contain 10 numbers only etc. in middlewares i manage to add middlewares in such way so that it can provide the session details.
